A port of the ancient Conquer v4 to rust.

This is the venerable Conquer v4.10 strategy building game from USENET.
It's mostly an excuse to try porting some old monolithic C code into Rust
so I can learn the rust language.

But who knows... maybe I'll get a curses library and make it work fully,
or get ambitious enough to write this as a backend and then make a
graphics front-end in python or even HTML5/javascript...
